Max. dose: 2.1 g\/24 hr.\n\nUsed in the resuscitation algorithm for ventricular fibrillation\/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (see front cover for arrest dosing and back cover for PALS algorithm).\nOverall use of this drug may be limited to its potentially life-threatening side effects and the difficulties associated with managing its use.\n\nContraindicated in severe sinus node dysfunction, marked sinus bradycardia, second- and third degree AV block. Use with caution in hepatic impairment. \nLong elimination half-life (40–55 days). Major metabolite is active. Use of premixed injection (Nexterone) is not recommended in renal insufficiency due to accumulation of cyclodextrin excipient.\n\nIncreases cyclosporine, digoxin, phenytoin, tacrolimus, warfarin, calcium channel blockers, theophyl-line, and quinidine levels. Amiodarone is a CYP P450 3A3\/4 substrate and inhibits CYP 3A3\/4, 2C9,and 2D6. Risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased when used with simvastatin at doses greater than 20 mg\/24 hr and lovastatin at doses greater than 40 mg\/24 hr. Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported when used with sofosbuvir.\n\nProposed therapeutic level with chronic oral use: 1–2.5 mg\/L.\n\nAsymptomatic corneal microdeposits should appear in all patients. Alters liver enzymes, thyroid function. Pulmonary fibrosis reported in adults. May cause worsening of preexisting arrhythmias with\nbradycardia and AV block. May also cause hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, paresthesias, ataxia, tremor, SIADH, and hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Drug rash with eosinophiliae systemic symptoms and acute respiratory distress has been reported\nCorrect hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia whenever possible before use as these conditions may exaggerate QTc prolongation.\nIntravenous continuous infusion concentration for peripheral administration should not exceed 2 mg\/mL and must be diluted with D5W. The intravenous dosage form can leach out plasticizers such as DEHP. \nIt is recommended to reduce the potential exposure to plasticizers in pregnant women and children at the toddler stages of development and younger by using alternative methods of IV drug administration.\nOral administration should be consistent with regards to meals because food increases the rate and extent of oral absorption."

See Chapter 2 for management of TCA toxic ingestion.\nT1\/2 = 9–25 hr in adults. Maximum antidepressant effects may not occur for 2 wk or more after initiation of therapy. Do not abruptly discontinue therapy in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods.\nTherapeutic levels (sum of amitriptyline and nortriptyline): 100–250 ng\/mL. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain a single level 8 hr or more after an oral dose (following 4–5 days of continuous dosing). Amitriptyline is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3\/4 and inhibitor for CYP 450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1. Rifampin can decrease amitriptyline levels.\nAmitriptyline may increase side effects of tramadol.\n\nSide effects include sedation, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, liver enzyme elevation, and arrhythmia. May discolor urine (blue\/green). QHS dosing during first weeks of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, and CBC at start of therapy and with dose changes.\n\nDecrease dose if PR interval reaches 0.22 s, QRS reaches 130% of baseline, HR rises above 140\/min, or if BP is > 140\/90. Tricyclics may cause mania. For antidepressant use, monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation\/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes."

Common adverse events included somnolence (25%), insomnia (20%), flu symptoms (15%), increased appetite (15%), and decreased appetite (15%).\n\nIncreased risk for serotonin syndrome when used with MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of discontinuance), linezolid, or methylene blue; concurrent use considered contraindicated. Do not use with pimozide because of increased QTc interval risk. Use with caution in hepatic or severe renal impairment; dosage adjustment may be needed. Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Diaphoresis, GI discomfort, xerostomia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue are common side effects. Abnormal bleeding, depression, QTc prolongation, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Primarily metabolized by the CYP450 2C19 and 3A4 enzymes and is a weak inhibitor for CYP450 2D6 enzyme. Taking with other medications with QTc prolongation may further increase that risk. Omeprazole may increase the toxicity of escitalopram. Doses may be administered with or without food."

Contraindicated in blood dyscrasias or hepatic dysfunction (prior or current); and hypersensitivity to meprobamate.\nAplastic anemia and hepatic failure leading to death have been associated with drug. May cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, GI disturbances, gingival hyperplasia, increased liver\nenzymes, and bone marrow suppression. Suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported. Obtain serum levels of concurrent anticonvulsants. Monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, CBC\nwith differential, platelets at baseline and every 1–2 wk. Doses should be decreased by 50% in renally impaired patients. When initiating adjunctive therapy (all ages), doses of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are reduced by 20% to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Further reductions of concomitant AED dosage may be necessary to minimize side\neffects caused by drug interactions. When converting to monotherapy, reduce other AEDs by one third at start of felbamate therapy. Then after 2 wk and at the start of increasing the felbamate dosage, reduce other AEDs by an additional one third. At wk 3, continue to reduce other AEDs as clinically indicated. Carbamazepine levels may be decreased; however, phenytoin and valproic acid levels may be\nincreased. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may increase felbamate clearance; valproic acid may decrease its clearance. Doses can be administered with or without food."

Highly lipophilic and may deposit into fat tissue. IV onset of action 1–2 min with peak effects in 10 min. IV duration of action 30–60 min. Give IV dose over 3–5 min. Rapid infusion may cause\nrespiratory depression and chest wall rigidity. Respiratory depression may persist beyond the period of analgesia. Transdermal onset of action 6–8 hr with a 72-hr duration of action. See Chapter 6 for\npharmacodynamic information with transmucosal and transdermal routes. Buccal tabs and oral lozenges are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in\npatients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy. Buccal tabs (Fentora) and lozenge (Actiq) dosage forms are available through a restricted distribution program (REMS)\nand are NOT bioequivalent (see package insert for conversion). Intranasal route of administration for analgesia has an onset of action at 10–30 min. Pediatric\nstudies have demonstrated that the intranasal fentanyl is equivalent to and better than morphine (PO\/IV\/IM) and equivalent to intravenous fentanyl for providing analgesia.\nFentanyl is a substrate for the CYP450 3A4 enzyme.

May further increase dose after several weeks. Usual dose range: 20–60 mg\/24 hr.\n\nBulimia:\n      Adolescent (PO; limited data): 20 mg QAM × 3 days, then 40 mg QAM × 3 days, then  60 mg QAM.\n       Adult: 60 mg QAM PO; it is recommended to titrate up to this dose over several days.\n\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder:\n    Adult: Start at 20 mg PO once daily continuously or intermittently (starting 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation through the first full day of menses and repeating with each new\ncycle) using the Sarafem product. Max. dose: 80 mg\/24 hr. Systematic evaluation has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of 6 mo at a dose of 20 mg\/day. Reassess patients periodically to\ndetermine the need for continued treatment.\n\n\nContraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (e.g., linezolid) due to possibility of seizures, hyperpyrexia, and coma. Use with caution in patients with angle-closure\nglaucoma, receiving diuretics, or with liver (reduce dose with cirrhosis) or renal impairment. May increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressants. May cause headache, insomnia,\nnervousness, drowsiness, GI disturbance, and weight loss. Increased bleeding diathesis with unaltered prothrombin time may occur with warfarin. Hyponatremia has been reported.\nMonitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation\/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.\nMay displace other highly protein-bound drugs. Inhibits CYP450 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3\/4 drug metabolism isoenzymes, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Use with serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans and methylene blue) and drugs that impair serotonin metabolism (MAOIs) may increase the risk for serotonin syndrome. Carefully review the\npatients’ medication profile for potential interactions. Delayed-release capsule is currently indicated for depression and is dosed at 90 mg Q7 days. It is unknown if weekly dosing provides the same protection from relapse as does daily dosing. Breast-feeding is not recommended by the manufacturer as adverse events in nursing infants have been reported. Fluoxetine and metabolite are variable and are higher when compared to other SSRIs. Maternal use of SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum may result in more difficult breastfeeding. Infants exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy may also have an increased risk for\npersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn."

The Gralise dosage form is designed for once daily administration with evening meals, whereas the Horizant dosage form is dosed once daily-BID. See specific product information for details. Generally used as adjunctive therapy for partial and secondary generalized seizures and neuropathic pain. Somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus were common when used for seizures (≥12 yr). Viral infections, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility have been\nreported in patients aged 3–12 yr receiving other antiepiletics. Dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema are common side effects in adults with postherpetic neuralgia. Suicidal behavior or ideation and multiorgan hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, or DRESS) have been reported. Do not withdraw medication abruptly (withdraw gradually over a minimum of 1 wk). Drug is not metabolized by the liver and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Higher\ndoses may be required for children aged <5 yr because of faster clearance in this age group. May be taken with or without food.

Use with caution if platelets < 50,000\/mm3. Avoid IM injections and other medications affecting platelet function (e.g., NSAIDS and ASA). Toxicities include bleeding, allergy, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. Adjust dose with one of the following laboratory goals: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) anti-Xa level: 0.3–0.7 units\/mL aPTT level (reagent specific to reflect anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7 units\/mL): 50–80 seconds.\nThese laboratory measurements are best measured 4–6 hr after initiation or changes in infusion rate. Do not collect blood from the heparinized line or same extremity as site of heparin infusion. If unfractionated heparin anti-Xa or aPTT levels are not available, a ratio of aPPT 1.5–2.5 times the control value has been used in the past. Unfractionated heparin anti-Xa level is NOT THE SAME as low-molecular-weight heparin anti-Xa (used for monitoring low-molecular-weight heparin products\nsuch as enoxaparin). Use preservative-free heparin in neonates. Note: heparin flush doses may alter aPTT in small patients; consider using more dilute heparin in these cases. Use actual body weight when dosing obese patients. Due to recent regulatory changes to the manufacturing process, heparin products may exhibit decreased potency. Antidote: Protamine sulfate (1 mg per 100 U heparin in previous 4 hr). For low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), see Enoxaparin.\n"

Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment. Side effects include sedation, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and arrhythmia. QHS dosing during first weeks of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, and CBC at start of therapy and with dose changes. Tricyclics may cause mania. Therapeutic reference range (sum of imipramine and desipramine) = 150–250 ng\/mL. Levels > 1000 ng\/mL are toxic; however, toxicity may occur at >300 ng\/mL.\nRecommended serum sampling time at steady state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 5–7 days of continuous therapy. Carbamazepine may reduce imipramine levels, and cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, labetolol, and quinidine may increase imipramine levels. Onset of antidepressant effects: 1–3 wk.

If adverse reactions occur, stop infusion until side effects subside and may restart at rate that was previously tolerated.\n      IM: Administer in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or deltoid muscle of the upper arm.\n            Avoid gluteal region because of risk of injury to sciatic nerve. \n             Consider splitting doses for multiple injection sites to address age specific maximum IM injection volumes. \n     Subcutaneous (SC) preparation:\n           Converting to SC route from previous IV dosage for patients receiving IV immune globulin (IVIG) infusions at regular intervals for at least 3 mo (≥2 yr):\n                Initial weekly dose (start 1 wk after last IV dose):\n                   Dose (g) = 1.53 × Previous IVIG dose in grams (g) ÷ number of weeks between IVIG doses\n\nTo convert the above dose in grams to milliliters of drug, multiply dose (g) by 5.\nAdjust dose over time by clinical response and serum IgG trough levels. Obtain a previous trough level from IVIG therapy prior to SC conversion, and repeat trough level 2–3 mo after initiating the SC route. \nA goal trough with the SC route of ~290 mg\/dL higher than a trough with the IV route has been recommended.\n\nSC administration: Injection sites include the abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and\/or lateral hip. Doses may be administered into multiple sites (spaced ≥ 2 inches apart) simultaneously.  (missing table)\n\nUse with caution in patients with an increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., hypercoagulable states, prolonged immobilization, in-dwelling catheters, estrogen use, thrombosis history, cardiovascular risks, and hyperviscosity) or hemolysis (e.g., non-O blood type, associated inflammatory conditions, and receiving high cumulative doses of immune globulins over several days). May cause flushing, chills, fever, headache, and hypotension. Hypersensitivity reaction may occur when IV form is administered rapidly. Maltose containing products may cause an osmotic diuresis. May cause anaphylaxis in IgA-deficient patients due to varied amounts of IgA. Some products are IgA depleted; consult a pharmacist. To decrease risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, IV preparations containing sucrose should not be infused at a rate such that the amount of sucrose exceeds 3 mg\/kg\/min. SC route provides higher serum trough levels, lower rate of adverse reactions, and shorter administration time when compared with the IV route. Use an adjusted body weight [ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 0.5 (Actual Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight)] for dosing in obese patients has been recommended. Delay immunizations after immune globulin administration (see latest AAP Red Book for details).\n\n"

If needed, titrate dose upward at 1–2-week intervals to doses up to 0.61 mg\/kg\/24 hr or 40 mg\/24 hr (higher doses have not been evaluated).\n       Adult: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed, increase dose by 5–10 mg\/24 hr at 1–2 week intervals. Usual dosage range: 10–40 mg\/24 hr. Max. dose: 80 mg\/24 hr.\n\nUse lower initial dose (50% of recommended dose) if using with a diuretic or in the presence of hyponatremia, hypovolemia, severe CHF, or decreased renal function. Contraindicated in hypersensitivity and history of angioedema with other ACE inhibitors. Do not use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. Avoid use with dialysis with high-flux membranes because anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Use with caution in aortic or bilateral renal artery stenosis and hepatic impairment. Side effects include cough, dizziness, headache, hyperkalemia, hypotension (especially with concurrent diuretic or antihypertensive agent use), rash, and GI disturbances. Mood alterations, including depressive symptoms, have been reported. Dual blockade of the renin–angiotensin system with lisinopril and angiotensin receptor antagonist (e.g., losartan) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment. Use in diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents should be\nmonitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of use. NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin) may decrease linsinopril’s effects. Use with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus and everolimus) may increase risk for angioedema. Adjust dose in renal impairment . Onset of action: 1 hr with maximal effect in 6–8 hr. Lisinopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected. Additional indications with limited data in children include proteinuria associated with mild IgA nephropathy and renal protection for diabetes or renal parenchymal disease. "

If using Fortamet, max. dose is 2500 mg\/24 hr. If a dose > 2000 mg is needed, consider switching to nonextended-release tablets in divided doses and increase dose to a max. dose of 2550 mg\/24 hr.\n\nAssess patient’s eGFR prior to initiating therapy. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (<30 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), hepatic impairment (increased risk for lactic acidosis), CHF, metabolic acidosis, and during radiology studies using iodinated contrast media. Use with caution when transferring patients from chlorpropamide therapy (potential hypoglycemia risk), excessive alcohol intake, hypoxemia, dehydration, surgical procedures, mild\/moderate renal impairment, hepatic disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.\nFatal lactic acidosis (diarrhea; severe muscle pain, cramping; shallow and fast breathing; and unusual weakness and sleepiness) and decrease in vitamin B12 levels have been reported. May cause GI discomfort (~50% incidence), anorexia, and vomiting. Transient abdominal discomfort or diarrhea have been reported in 40% of pediatric patients. Cimetidine, furosemide, and nifedipine may increase the effects\/toxicity of metformin. In addition to monitoring serum glucose and\nglycosylated hemoglobin, monitor renal function and hematologic parameters (baseline and annual). Adult patients initiated on 500 mg PO BID may also have their dose increased to 850 mg PO BID after 2 wk.\nCOMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULFONYLUREAS: If patient has not responded to 4 wk of maximum doses of metformin monotherapy, consider gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea with continued maximum metformin dosing (even if failure with sulfonylurea has occurred). Attempt to identify the minimum effective dosage for each drug (metformin and sulfonylurea) because the combination can increase risk for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. If patient does not respond to 1–3 mo of\ncombination therapy with maximum metformin doses, consider discontinuing combination therapy and initiating insulin therapy.

Metoprolol is a CYP450 2D6 substrate. Avoid abrupt cessation of therapy in ischemic heart disease; angina, ventricular arrhythmias, and MI have occurred. Common side effects include bradyarrhythmia, heart block, heart failure, pruritus, rash, GI disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, and depression. Bronchospasm; dyspnea; and elevations in transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and LDH have all been reported. "

Use with caution in hepatic and renal impairment. No dosing adjustments are required based on race or gender or in patients with severe renal dysfunction or mild to moderate hepatic function impairment. Effect of severe hepatic function impairment on micafungin pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated. Higher dosage requirements in premature and young infants may be attributed to faster drug clearance due to lower protein binding. Higher treatment doses in infants and children have been reported at 8.6–12 mg\/kg\/dose IV once daily. May cause GI disturbances, phlebitis, rash, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test elevation, headache,\nfever, and rigor. Anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, TEN, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and hemolysis have been reported. Micafungin is CYP450 3A isoenzyme substrate and weak inhibitor. May increase the effects\/toxicity of nifedipine and sirolimus. Safety and efficacy in children ≥ 4 mo have been demonstrated based on well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic\/safety studies."

Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug for mycophenolic acid. Owing to differences in absorption, the delayed-release tablets should not be interchanged with other oral dosage forms on an equivalent\nmg-to-mg basis. Increases risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and increased risk of congenital malformations (especially external ear and facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, and esophagus).\nCommon side effects may include headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, anemia, fever, opportunistic infections, and sepsis. May increase the risk for bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections and lymphomas or other malignancies. GI bleeds and increased risk for rejection in heart transplant patients switched from calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and CellCept to sirolimus and CellCept have been reported. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported. Use with caution in patients with active GI disease or renal impairment (GFR < 25 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) outside of the immediate posttransplant period. In adults with renal impairment, avoid doses > 2 g\/24 hr and observe carefully. Dose should be interrupted or reduced in the presence of neutropenia (ANC < 1.3 × 103\/µL). No dose adjustment is needed for patients experiencing delayed graft function postoperatively. Drug interactions: (1) Displacement of phenytoin or theophylline from protein-binding sites will decrease total serum levels and increase free serum levels of these drugs. Salicylates displace mycophenolate to increase free levels of mycophenolate. (2) Competition for renal tubular secretion results in increased serum levels of acyclovir, ganciclovir, probenecid, and mycophenolate (when any of these are used together). (3) Avoid live and live attenuated vaccines (including influenza); decreases vaccine effectiveness. (4) Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, and telmisartan may reduce mycophenolate levels. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach. Infuse intravenous doses over 2 hr.

Use in children <1 yr has not been recommended due to concerns of excessive CNS penetration and fatalities in 7-day-old rats. Nausea and vomiting generally occur within the first 2 days and are the most common adverse effects. Insomnia, vertigo, seizures, hypothermia, neuropsychiatric events (may result in fatal outcomes), arrhythmias, rash, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Reduce dosage treatment dose if GFR is 10–30 mL\/min to 75 mg PO once daily × 5 days for adults. \nPROPHYLACTIC USE: Oseltamivir is not a substitute for annual flu vaccination. Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated for ≤6 wk of therapy; duration of protection lasts for as long as dosing is continued. Adjust prophylaxis dose if GFR is 10–30 mL\/min by extending the dosage interval to once every other day. Probenecid increases oseltamivir levels. Oseltamivir decreases the efficacy of the nasal influenza vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist); avoid administration of vaccine within 2 wk\nbefore or 48 hrs after oseltamivir administration, unless medically indicated.Dosage adjustments in hepatic impairment, severe renal disease and dialysis have not been established for either treatment or prophylactic use. The safety and efficacy of repeated treatment or prophylaxis courses have not been evaluated. Doses may be administered with or without food"

May also cause headache, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus urticaria, diplopia, abnormal gait, and GI discomfort. About 25%–30% of patients with\ncarbamazepine hypersensitivity will experience a cross reaction with oxcarbazepine. Serious dermatological reactions (Stevens–Johnson and TEN), multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow depression, osteoporosis, pancreatitis, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema, and suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported. Inhibits CYP450 2C19 and induces CYP450 3A4\/5 drug-metabolizing enzymes. Carbamazepine, cyclosporine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid, and verapamil may decrease oxcarbazepine levels. Oxcarbazepine may increase phenobarbital and phenytoin levels. Oxcarbazepine can decrease the effects of oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, felodipine, and lamotrigine. If GFR < 30 mL\/min, adjust dosage by administering 50% of the normal starting dose (max. dose: 300 mg\/24 hr) followed by a slower than normal increase in dose if necessary. No dosage adjustment is required in mild\/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment due to lack of information.

See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing. Check dosages of acetaminophen or aspirin when using combination products (e.g., Percocet, Percodan). Oxycodone is metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 (major) and 2D6 (minor)\nisoenzyme. When using controlled-release tablets (e.g., Oxycontin), determine patient’s total 24-hr requirements and divide by 2 to administer on a Q12-hr dosing interval. Oxycontin 80-mg tablet is USED ONLY for opioid tolerant patients; this strength can cause fatal respiratory depression in opioid-naïve patients.

Common side effects include diarrhea and headache. May cause transient elevation in LFTs. Like other PPIs, may increase risk for C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Hypomagnesemia has been reported with long-term use. Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria), agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and taste disorders have been reported. Drug is a substrate for CYP450 2C19 (major), 2D6 (minor), and 3A3\/4 (minor) isoenzymes. May decrease the absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, and ampicillin esters. May increase the effect\/toxicity of methotrexate. Children aged 1–2 yr have demonstrated more rapid clearance of pantoprazole in pharmacokinetic studies; this age group may require higher doses. All oral doses may be taken with or without food. Do not crush or chew tablets. The extemporaneously compounded oral suspension may be less bioavailable owing to the loss of the enteric coating. Granules for delayed-release oral suspension product may be mixed with 5 mL apple juice (administer immediately followed by rinsing container with more apple juice) or sprinkled on 1 teaspoonful of apple sauce (administer within 10 min); see package insert for NG administration.

IM administration is not recommended because of erratic absorption and pain at injection site; consider fosphenytoin. Side effects include gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, dermatitis, blood dyscrasia, ataxia, lupus-like and Stevens–Johnson syndromes, lymphadenopathy, liver damage, and nystagmus. Suicidal behavior or ideation and multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS) have been reported. An increased risk for serious skin reactions (e.g., TEN and Stevens–Johnson syndrome) may occur in patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele. Many drug interactions: levels may be increased by cimetidine, chloramphenicol, INH, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, etc. Levels may be decreased by some antineoplastic agents. Phenytoin induces hepatic microsomal enzymes (CYP450 1A2, 2C8\/9\/19, and 3A3\/4), leading to decreased effectiveness of oral contraceptives, fosamprenavir (used without ritonavir), quinidine, valproic\nacid, theophylline, and other substrates to the previously listed CYP450 hepatic enzymes. May increase levels of amprenavir when administered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir. May cause resistance to neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium). Suggested dosing intervals for specific oral dosage forms: extended-release caps (once daily–BID); chewable tablets, and oral suspension (TID). Oral absorption reduced in neonates. T1\/2 is variable (7–42 hr) and dose-dependent. Drug is highly protein-bound; free fraction of drug will be increased in patients with hypoalbuminemia. For seizure disorders, therapeutic levels: 10–20 mg\/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1–2 mg\/L (free only). Monitor free phenytoin levels in hypoalbuminemia or renal insufficiency. Recommended serum sampling times: trough level (PO\/IV) within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose; peak or postload level (IV) 1 hr after the end of IV infusion. Steady state is usually achieved after 5–10 days of continuous dosing. For routine monitoring, measure trough. IV push\/infusion rate: Not to exceed 0.5 mg\/kg\/min in neonates, or 1 mg\/kg\/min infants, children, and adults with max. dose of 50 mg\/min; may cause cardiovascular collapse. Consider fosphenytoin in situations of tenuous IV access and risk for extravasation"

Use with caution in hypovolemia and diabetes mellitus.\nSuicidal ideation\/behavior or worsening depression may occur especially in children and young adults during the first few months of therapy or during dosage changes. Common side effects in children include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactenemia, and\nsignificant weight gain. Other common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal pain, GI disturbances, increase appetite, xerostomia, increase serum transaminases, EPS, headache, dizziness, agitation, and fatigue. Anaphylactic reactions, DRESS, TEN, SIADH, cardiomyopathy, priapism, DKA, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, agranulocystosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, cataracts, hypothyroidism, neuroleptic\nmalignant syndrome, and seizures have been reported. Do not abruptly discontinue medication as acute withdrawal symptoms may occur. Dosage adjustment in hepatic impairment may be necessary as it is primarily heptically metabolized. Quetiapine is a\nmajor substrate for CYP450 3A4 and minor substrate for 2D6. Opiods and other CNS depressants may enhance CNS depressant effects. Carbamazepine may decrease the effects of quetiapine.Quetiapine may decrease dopamine agonist effects (e.g., antiparkinson agents) but may enhance the anticholinergic and QTc prolongation effects to those medications pocessing these risks. Alwayscheck for drug interactions as effects can be mild to severe. Nonextended-release dosage forms may be administered with or without food.

Maintenance dose: 0.02 mg\/kg\/min IV as continuous infusion until oral therapy can be initiated. If more than 48 hr of intravenous therapy is required, reduce dose by 30%–50%.\nTest dose is given to assess for idiosyncratic reaction to quinidine. Toxicity indicated by increase of QRS interval by ≥0.02 sec (skip dose or stop drug). May cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, hypotension, tinnitus, TTP, rash, heart block and blood dyscrasias. When\nused alone, may cause 1:1 conduction in atrial flutter leading to ventricular fibrillation. Patients may develop idiosyncratic ventricular tachycardia with low levels, especially when therapy is being initiated. Quinidine is a substrate of CYP 450 3A3\/4 and 3A5–7 enzymes, and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3\/4 enzymes. Can cause increase in digoxin levels. Quinidine potentiates the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents, beta blockers, anticholinergics, and warfarin. Amiodarone, antacids, delavirdine, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, saquinavir, ritonavir, verapamil, or cimetidine may enhance the drug’s effect. Barbiturates, phenytoin, cholinergic drugs, nifedipine, sucralfate, or rifampin may reduce quinidine’s effect. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (15%–25% of drug is\neliminated unchanged in the urine), myocardial depression, sick sinus syndrome, G6PD deficiency, and hepatic dysfunction. Therapeutic levels (antiarrhythmic): 3–7 mg\/L. Recommended serum sampling times at steady state: trough level obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 1–2 days of continuous dosing (steady state).

Should not be used to relieve symptoms of acute asthma. It is long acting and has its onset of action in 10–20 min, with a peak effect at 3 hr. May be used QHS (1 inhalation of\nthe DPI) for nocturnal symptoms. Salmeterol is a chronic medication and is not used in similar fashion to short-acting β-agonists (e.g., albuterol). Patients already receiving salmeterol Q12 hr should not use additional doses for prevention of exercise-induced\nbronchospasm; consider alternative therapy. Asthma exacerbations or hospitalizations were reported to be lower when used with an inhaled corticosteroid. WARNING: Long-acting β2-agonists may increase the risk for asthma-related death. A subgroup\nanalysis suggested higher risk in African-American patients compared with Caucasians. Use salmeterol only as additional therapy for patients not adequately controlled on other asthmacontroller medications (e.g., low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly requires initiation of treatment with two maintenance therapies. Should not be used in conjunction with an inhaled, long-acting β2-agonist and is not a substitute for inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. Use with strong CYP 450 3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, and telithromycin) is not recommended due to risk for cardiovascular adverse events (e.g., QTc prolongation, tachycardia). Salmeterol is a\nCYP 450 3A substrate. Proper patient education is essential. Side effects are similar to those of albuterol. Hypertension and arrhythmias have been reported. See Chapter 24 for recommendations for asthma controller therapy"

Use with caution in sepsis (high levels of cGMP may potentiate hypotension), hypotension, and sickle cell anemia (use not established) and with concurrent CYP450 3A4 inhibiting medications (see discussion that follows) and antihypertensive medications. Hepatic insufficiency or severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL\/min) significantly reduces sildenafil clearance.\nFindings from a dose-ranging study in 1–17-year olds with pulmonary arterial hypertension showed an association of increased mortality risk with long-term use (>2 yr). Headache, pyrexia, URTIs, vomiting, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported side effects in this study. Optimal dosing based on age and body weight still needs to be determined. Hazard ratios for mortality were 3.95 (95% CI: 1.46–10.65) for high versus low doses and 1.92 (95% CI: 0.65–5.65) for medium versus low doses in follow up study for those receiving therapy for ≥3 yr. A subsequent extension open-label study on the same population for an additional 16 weeks reported a greater hazard ratio for mortality with high dose vs. low dose therapy (p = 0.007). In adults, a transient impairment of color discrimination may occur; this effect could increase risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates. Common side effects reported in adults include flushing, rash, diarrhea, indigestion, headache, abnormal vision, and nasal congestion. Hearing\nloss has been reported. Sildenafil is substrate for CYP450 3A4 (major) and 2C8\/9 (minor). Azole antifungals, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, verapamil, and grapefruit juice may increase the effects\/toxicity of sildenafil. Bosentin, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort, and high-fat meals may decrease sildenafil effects."

Adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels.\n\nIncreased susceptibility to infection and development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression. Fatal bronchial anastomotic dehiscence has been reported in lung transplantation. Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis have been\nreported in liver transplantation when used with tacrolimus. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. Increase risk of BK virus-associated\nnephropathies has been reported. Increased mortality in stable liver transplant patients has been reported after conversion from a calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen to sirolimus. Monitor whole blood trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state), especially with pediatric patients, hepatic impairment, concurrent use of CYP450 3A4 and\/or P-gp inducers and inhibitors, and\/or if cyclosporine dosage is markedly changed or discontinued. Steady state is generally achieved after 5–7 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on specific treatment protocol and assay methodology (HPLC vs. immunoassay vs. LC\/MS\/MS). Younger children may exhibit faster sirolimus clearance compared with adolescents. Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP450 3A4 and P-gp. Cyclosporine, diltiazem, protease inhibitors, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, and other inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 may increase the toxicity of sirolimus. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John’s wort may decrease the effects of sirolimus. Strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals and clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., rifamycins) are not recommended. Hypertension, peripheral edema, increase serum creatinine, dyspnea, epistaxis, headache, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arthralgia may occur. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diabetes mellitus, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ovarian cysts, and menstrual disorders have been reported. Urinary tract infections have been reported in pediatric renal transplant patients with high immunologic risk. Two mg of the oral solution has been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to 2 mg tablets. However, it is not known whether they are still therapeutically equivalent at higher doses. Reduce maintenance dosage by 1\/3 in the presence of hepatic function impairment. Administer doses consistently with or without food. When administered with cyclosporine, give dose 4 hr after cyclosporine. Do not crush or split tablets. Measure the oral liquid dosage form with an amber oral syringe and dilute in a cup with 60 mL of water or orange juice only.

For rapid sequence intubation, see Chapter 1.\nContraindicated after the acute phase of an injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury because severe hyperkalemia and subsequent cardiac arrest may occur. Cardiac arrest has been reported in children and adolescents primarily with skeletal muscle myopathies (e.g., Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy). Identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy prior to use. Predose creatine kinase may be useful for identifying patients at risk.\nMonitoring of ECG for peaked T-waves may be useful in detecting early signs of this adverse effect. May cause malignant hyperthermia (use dantrolene to treat), bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia, and hyperkalemia. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported; use caution if previous anaphylactic reaction to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Use with caution in patients with severe burns, paraplegia, or crush injuries and in patients with preexisting hyperkalemia. Beware of prolonged depression in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, pseudocholinesterase deficiency, hypothermia, and those receiving aminoglycosides, phenothiazines, quinidine, β-blockers, amphotericin B, cyclophosphamide, diuretics, lithium, acetylcholine, and anticholinesterases.\nDiazepam may decrease neuromuscular blocking effects.

IV dosage form contraindicated in patients allergic to polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil (cremophor). Experience in pediatric kidney transplantation is limited. Pediatric patients may require higher mg\/kg doses than adults. For BMT use (beginning 1 day before BMT), dose and therapeutic levels similar to those in liver transplantation have been used. Major adverse events include tremor, headache, insomnia, diarrhea, constipation, hypertension, nausea, and renal dysfunction. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, confusion, depression, infections, lymphoma, liver enzyme elevation, and coagulation disorders may also occur. GI perforation, agranulocytosis, and hemolytic anemia have been reported.\nTacrolimus is a substrate of the CYP450 3A4 drug metabolizing enzyme. Calcium channel blockers, imidazole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clotrimazole, and posaconazole), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin), cisapride, cimetidine, cyclosporine, danazol, herbal products containing schisandra sphenanthera extracts, methylprednisolone, and grapefruit juice can increase tacrolimus serum levels. In contrast, carbamazepine, caspofungin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, and sirolimus may decrease levels. Use with sirolimus may increase risk for hepatic artery thrombosis. Use with other CYP450 3A inhibitors and substrates has the potential to prolong the cardiac QT interval. Reduce dose in renal or hepatic insufficiency Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after 2–5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay methodology (whole-blood ELISA vs. MEIA vs. HPLC). Whole-blood trough concentrations of 5–20 ng\/ mL have been recommended in liver transplantation at 1–12 mo. Trough levels of 7–20 ng\/mL (whole blood) for the first 3 mo and 5–15 ng\/mL after 3 mo have been recommended in renaltransplantation.\nTacrolimus therapy generally should be initiated 6 hr or more after transplantation. PO is the preferred route of administration, and administration should be done on an empty stomach. Safety and efficacy of the extended-release capsules (Astragraf XL) have not been established for kidney transplant patients < 16 yr old. Extended-release tablets (Envarsus XR) are currently labelled for use in adult kidney transplant patients being converted from an immediate-release tacrolimus formulation. An 80% conversion factor has been recommended for African-Americans converted from immediate-release dosage form to Envarsus XR. All extended-release formulations are NOT interchangeable. IV infusions should be administered at concentrations between 0.004 and\n0.02 mg\/mL diluted with NS or D5W. \n\nTOPICAL USE: Not recommended for use in patients with skin conditions with a skin barrier defect with the potential for systemic absorption. Do not use in children < 2 yr, immunocompromised patients, or patients with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Approved as a second-line therapy for short-term and intermittent treatment of atopic dermatitis for patients who fail to respond or do not tolerate other approved therapies. Long-term safety is unknown. Skin burn\nsensation, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reaction, skin erythema, headache, and skin infection are the most common side effects. Application site edema has been reported. Although the risk is uncertain, the FDA has issued an alert about the potential cancer risk with the use of this product.

Longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used. Use with caution in renal and hepatic dysfunction (decreased clearance) and sulfa hypersensitivity. Reduce dose by 50% when creatinine clearance is < 70 mL\/min. Common side effects (incidence lower in children) include ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, dizziness, nystagmus, paresthesia, sedation, visual disturbances, nausea, dyspepsia, and kidney stones (incidence higher in children). Secondary angle closure glaucoma characterized by ocular pain, acute myopia, and increased intraocular pressure has been reported and may lead to blindness if left untreated. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if\nthey experience blurred vision or periorbital pain. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia have been reported primarily in children and should be monitored especially during hot weather and with use of drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders (e.g., carbonic anyhdrase inhibitors and anticholinergics). Low serum bicarbonate levels have been reported in pediatric clinical trials. Hyperchloremic, non–anion gap metabolic acidosis has also been reported. Suicidal behavior or\nideation has been reported. Drug is metabolized by and inhibits the CYP450 2C19 isoenzyme. Phenytoin, valproic acid, and carbamazepine may decrease topiramate levels. Topiramate may decrease valproic acid, digoxin, and ethinyl estradiol (to decrease oral contraceptive efficacy), but may increase phenytoin levels. Alcohol and CNS depressants may increase CNS side effects. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) may increase risk of metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, or paresthesia. Use with\nvalproic acid may result in the development of hyperammonemia. Safety and efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in pediatrics have not been established; an increase in serum creatinine has been reported in a clinical trial.\nQudexy XR and Trokendi XR are not bioequivalent and should not be interchanged. Doses may be administered with or without food. Capsule may be opened and sprinkled on small amount of food (e.g., 1 teaspoonful of applesauce) and swallowed whole (do not chew).

BSA is determined by the Mosteller equation and CrCl is determined by a modified Schwartz equation (max. value: 150 mL\/ min\/1.73 m2).\n\nMosteller BSA (m2) equation: square root of [(height (cm) × weight (kg)) ÷ 3600]\nModified Schwartz (mL\/min\/1.73 m2) equation (max. value: 150 mL\/min\/1.73 m2): k × height (cm) ÷ serum creatinine (mg\/dL); where k = 0.33 if patient is < 1 yr old with low birth weight for gestational age; k = 0.45 if patient is < 1 yr old with birth weight appropriate for gestational age or if patient is 1–<2 yr old; k = 0.55 for boys 2–<13 yr old and girls 2–<16 yr old; or k = 0.7 for boys 13–16 yr old.\n\nDuration of therapy:\n       Kidney transplantation (≥4 mo–16 yr): 200 days\n       Heart transplantation (≥1 mo–16 yr): 100 days\n       Liver transplantation: see remarks.\n\nAdolescent (>16 yr) and adult:\n   CMV retinitis:\n            Induction therapy: 900 mg PO BID × 21 days with food\n            Maintenance therapy: 900 mg PO once daily with food\n\nCMV prophylaxis in heart, kidney, and kidney-pancreas transplantation: 900 mg PO once daily starting within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post heart or kidney–pancreas transplantation, or until 200 days post kidney transplantation.\n\nThis prodrug is metabolized to ganciclovir, with better oral absorption than ganciclovir. Contraindicated with hypersensitivity to valganciclovir\/ganciclovir; ANC < 500 mm3; platelets < 25,000 mm3; hemoglobin < 8 g\/dL; and patients on hemodialysis. Use with\ncaution in renal insufficiency (adjust dose; see Chapter 30), preexisting bone marrow suppression, or in those receiving myelosupressive drugs or irradiation. Has not been evaluated in hepatic impairment. May cause headache, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy,\ndiarrhea, vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia incidence is greater at day 200 vs day 100 in pediatric kidney transplant patients. Use effective contraception during and for at least 90 days after therapy; may impair fertility in men\nand women. See Ganciclovir for drug interactions and additional adverse effects. CMV prophylaxis data in liver transplantation is limited. A retrospective review in 10 pediatric patients, mean age 4.9 ± 5.6 yr, showed that 15–18 mg\/kg\/dose PO once daily × 100 days\nfollowing liver transplantation resulted in 1 case of asymptomatic CMV infection detected by CMV antigenemia at day 7 of therapy. This patient then received a higher dose of 15 mg\/kg\/dose BID until three consecutive negative CMV antigenemia were achieved. The dose was switched back to a prophylactic regimen at day 46 posttransplant. Monitor serum creatinine levels regularly and consider body changes to height and body weight for prophylaxis dosing. Valganciclovir CANNOT be substituted for ganciclovir on a one-to-one basis. All doses are administered with food. Avoid direct skin or mucous membrane contact with broken or crushed tablets"

Dose may be increased to a max. of 1000 mg\/24 hr ÷ PO BID. If using divalproex sodium extended-release tablets, administer daily dose once daily.\n\nContraindicated in hepatic disease, pregnancy (for migraine indication), mitochondrial disorders with mutations in DNA polymerase gamma (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome), and children < 2 yr suspected of the aforementioned mitochondrial disorder. May cause GI, liver, blood, and CNS toxicity; weight gain; transient alopecia; pancreatitis (potentially life-threatening); nausea; sedation; vomiting; headache; thrombocytopenia (dose-related); platelet dysfunction; rash (especially with lamotrigine); and hyperammonemia. Hepatic failure has occurred especially in children < 2 yr (especially those receiving multiple anticonvulsants, with congenital metabolic disorders, with severe seizure disorders with mental retardation, and with organic brain disease). Idiosyncratic life-threatening pancreatitis has been reported in children and adults. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has been reported in patients with urea cycle disorders. Suicidal behavior or ideation, male infertility, elevated testosterone, decreased bone mineral density, DRESS, hair texture\/color changes, and nail\/nail bed disorders have been reported. Valproic acid is a substrate for CYP450 2C19 isoenzyme and an inhibitor of CYP450 2C9, 2D6, and 3A3\/4 (weak). It increases amitriptyline\/nortriptyline, rufinamide, phenytoin, diazepam, and phenobarbital levels. Concomitant phenytoin, phenobarbital, topiramate, meropenem, cholestyramine, and carbamazepine may decrease valproic acid levels. Amitriptyline or nortriptyline may increase valproic acid levels. May interfere with urine ketone and thyroid tests. Do not give syrup with carbonated beverages. Use of IV route has not been evaluated for >14 days of continuous use. Infuse IV over 1 hr up to a max. rate of 20 mg\/min. Depakote and Depakote ER are NOT bioequivalent; see package insert for dose conversion. Therapeutic levels: 50–100 mg\/L. Recommendations for serum sampling at steady-state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 2–3 days of continuous dosing. Levels of 50–60 mg\/L and as high as 85 mg\/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders. Monitor CBC and LFTs prior to and during therapy. Valprioc acid and divalproex should not be used in pregnant women. Increased risk of neural tube defects, decreased child IQ scores, craniofacial defects, and cardiovascular malformations have been reported in babies exposed to valproic acid and divalproex sodium.

Greater nephrotoxicity risk has been associated with higher therapeutic serum trough concentrations (≥15 mg\/mL), concurrent piperacillin\/tazobactam therapy, and receiving furosemide in the intensive care unit. Adjust dose in renal failure. Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Low concentrations of the drug may appear in CSF with inflamed meninges. Nausea, vomiting, and drug-induced erythroderma are common with IV use. “Red man syndrome” associated with rapid IV infusion may occur. Infuse over 60 min (may infuse over 120 min if 60 min infusion is not tolerated). NOTE: Diphenhydramine is used to reverse red man syndrome.\nAllergic reactions [including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)], neutropenia, and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia have been reported. Although current extrapolated adult guidelines suggest measuring only trough levels, an additional postdistributional level may be useful in characterizing enhanced\/altered drug clearance for quicker dosage modification to attain target levels; this may be useful for infants with known faster clearance and patients in renal compromise. Consult a pharmacist The following therapeutic trough level recommendations are based on the assumption that the pathogen’s Vancomycin MIC is ≤ 1 mg\/L. Indication Goal Trough Level Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection, non-MRSA bacteremia,\nfebrile neutropenia 10–15 mg\/L CNS infections, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, MRSA bacteremia 15–20 mg\/L Peak level measurement (20–50 mg\/L) has also been recommended for patients with burns, clinically nonresponsive in 72 hr of therapy, with persistent positive cultures, and with CNS infections (≥30 mg\/L). Recommended serum sampling time at steady-state: Trough within 30 min prior to the fourth consecutive dose and peak 60 min after the administration of the fourth consecutive dose. Infants\nwith faster elimination (shorter T1\/2) may be sampled around the third consecutive dose. ORAL USE: Metronidazole (PO) is the drug of choice for C. difficile colitis; vancomycin should be avoided due to the emergence of vancomycin resistant enterococcus. Common adverse effects with oral vancomycin capsules in adults include nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia.

Common side effects include GI disturbances, fever, headache, hepatic abnormalities, photosensitivity (avoid direct sunlight and use protective measures), rash (6%), and visual disturbances (30%). Serious but rare side effects include anaphylaxis, liver or renal failure, and Stevens–Johnsons syndrome. Pancreatitis has been reported in children. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin levels weekly for the first month of therapy followed by reduced frequency has been recommended. Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels before and during voriconzole therapy. Adjust dose in hepatic impairment by decreasing only the maintenance dose by 50% for patients with a Child-Pugh Class A or B. Do not use IV dosage form for patients with GFR <50 mL\/min because of accumulation of the cyclodextrin excipient; switch to oral therapy if possible. Patients receiving concurrent phenytoin should increase their voriconazole maintenance doses (IV: 5 mg\/kg\/dose Q 12 hr; PO: double the usual dose). See www.clinicaltrials.gov for updated Pediatrics clinical trial information. Interoccasion  pharmacokinetic variability is high, thus requiring serum level monitoring. Therapeutic levels: trough:\n1–5.5 mg\/L. Levels <1 mg\/L have resulted in treatment failures and levels >5.5 mg\/L have resulted in neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy.

Chloramphenicol, chloral hydrate, cimetidine, delavirdine, fluconazole, fluoxetine, metronidazole, indomethacin, large doses of vitamins A or E, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, omeprazole, oxandrolone, quinidine, salicylates, SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), sulfonamides, and zafirlukast may increase warfarin’s effect. Ascorbic acid, barbiturates, carbamazepine, cholestyramine, dicloxacillin, griseofulvin, oral contraceptives, rifampin, spironolactone, sucralfate, and vitamin K (including foods with high content) may decrease warfarin’s effect. Younger children generally require higher doses to achieve desired effect. A cohort study of 319 children found that infants < 1 yr required an average daily dose of 0.33 mg\/kg and teenagers 11–18 yr required 0.09 mg\/kg to maintain a target INR of 2–3. Children receiving Fontan cardiac surgery may require smaller doses than children with either congenital heart disease (without Fontan) or no congenital heart disease. [See Chest. 2004;126:645–687S and Blood. 1999;94(9):3007–3014 for additional information.]\nLower initial doses should be considered for patients with pharmacogenetic variations in CYP2C9 (e.g., *2 and *3 alleles) and VKORC1 (e.g., 1639G>A allele) enzymes, elderly and\/or debilitated patients, and patients with a potential to exhibit greater than expected PT\/INR response to warfarin. The international normalized ratio (INR) is the recommended test to monitor warfarin anticoagulant effect. It takes 5–7 days for an INR to reach steady state on a consistent dosing schedule. The particular INR desired is based upon the indication and has been extrapolated from adults. An INR of 2–3 has been recommended for prophylaxis and treatment of DVT, pulmonary emboli, and bioprosthetic heart valves. An INR of 2.5–3.5 has been recommended for mechanical prosthetic heart valves and the prevention of recurrent systemic emboli. If PT is monitored, it should be 1.5–2 times the control. Patients at high risk for bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring. Onset of action occurs within 36–72 hr and peak effects occur within 5–7 days. IV dosing is equivalent to PO doses and is used in situations where oral dosing is not possible. The antidote is vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. Pregnancy category is “D” for women with mechanical heart valves and “X” for all others indications"

Dosage reduction is recommended in severe renal impairment and may be necessary in hepatic dysfunction. Drug penetrates well into the CNS. Most common side effects include anemia,\ngranulocytopenia, nausea, and headache (dosage reduction, erythropoietin, filgrastim\/GCSF, or discontinuance may be required depending on event). Seizures, confusion, rash, myositis, myopathy (use > 1 yr), hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Macrocytosis is noted after 4 wk of therapy and can be used as an indicator of compliance Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases have been reported. Neutropenia and severe anemia has been reported in advanced HIV disease. Do not use in combination with stavudine because of poor antiretroviral effect. Effects of interacting drugs include increased toxicity (acyclovir and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); increased hematological toxicity (ganciclovir, interferon-α, and marrow suppressive drugs); and granulocytopenia (drugs which affect glucuronidation). Methadone, atovaquone, cimetidine, valproic acid, probenecid, and fluconazole may increase levels of zidovudine. Whereas, rifampin, rifabutin,\nand clarithromycin may decrease levels. Do not administer IM. IV form is incompatible with blood product infusions and should be infused over 1 hr (intermittent IV dosing). Despite manufacturer recommendations of administering oral\ndoses 30 min prior to or 1 hr after meals, doses may be administered with food"

Then increase by 2–5 mg\/kg\/24 hr every 2–4 day until seizures disappear, up to a maximum of 20 mg\/kg\/24 hr.\n\n>16 yr–adult:\n     Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures: 100 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Dose may be increased to 200 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Additional dosage increments of 100 mg\/24 hr can be made at 2 wk intervals to allow attainment of steady-state levels. Effective doses have ranged from 100 to 600 mg\/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID (BID dosing may provide better efficacy). No additional benefit has been shown for doses >400 mg\/24 hr.\n\nBecause zonisamide is a sulfonamide, it is contraindicated in patients allergic to sulfonamides (may result in Stevens–Johnson syndrome or TEN). Common side effects of drowsiness, ataxia, anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, rash, and pruritis\nusually occur early in therapy and can be minimized with slow dose titration. Children are at increased risk for hyperthermia and oligohydrosis, especially in warm or hot weather. Suicidal behavior or ideation, acute pancreatitis, urolithiasis, metabolic acidosis (more frequent and severe in younger patients), DRESS\/multiorgan hypersensitivity, rhabdomyolysis and elevated creatinine phosphokinase have been reported. Although not fully delineated, therapeutic serum levels of 20–30 mg\/L have been suggested as higher\nrates of adverse reactions have been seen at levels > 30 mg\/L. Zonisamide is a CYP450 3A4 substrate. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital can decrease levels of zonisamide. Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment; slower dose titration and more frequent monitoring is recommended. Do not use if GFR is < 50 mL\/min. Avoid abrupt discontinuation or radical dose reductions. Shallow capsules whole and do not crush or chew"

        <p class="cpg-text">Dehydration is a condition that can occur with excess loss of water and other body fluids.
            <br>Dehydration results from decreased intake, increased output (renal, gastrointestinal or insensible
            losses), a shift of fluids (ascitic, effusions) and capillary leak of fluids (burns and sepsis).

            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Use 2 intravenous solutions (D5,1/4 NS and D5 NS, both with the same concentration of potassium) at
                    the bedside can facilitate this approach by allowing for rapid adjustments of the rates of the 2
                    fluids.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Special considerations:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Infants due to high insensible water losses, may need to receive D5 0.2NS</li>
                <li>Diabetes insipidus, usually needs a more hypotonic fluid than a child with depletion of both sodium
                    and water due to diarrhoea</li>
                <li>In Diabetes insipidus give desmopressin as part of the treatment</li>
                <li>If a child has seizures as a result of brain edema secondary to rapid correction, administration of
                    hypotonic fluid should be stopped. An infusion of 3% saline can acutely increase the serum sodium;
                    an infusion of 4 mL/kg often results in resolution of the symptoms reversing the cerebral edema.
                </li>
                <li>Hyperglycemia from hypernatremia is not usually a problem and is not treated with insulin because
                    the acute decrease in glucose may precipitate cerebral edema by lowering plasma osmolality. Rarely,
                    the glucose concentration of intravenous fluids must be reduced (from D5W to D2.5W).</li>

                <li><strong>Antimotility agents</strong> (loperamide) are contraindicated in children with dysentery and

        <p class="cpg-headers">Reactions to Antivenom</p>
        <p>Most antivenom reactions are not caused by the acquired Type I (IgE mediated hypersensitivity), but by
            <strong>complement activation</strong> by IgG aggregates or FC fragments. It follows that the skin and
            conjunctival tests cannot predict<strong> early </strong>(anaphylactoid) or late (serum sickness) antivenom
            reactions, but delay the onset of treatment and may sensitize the patient.
        </p>

        <p>However, for assurance of the medical faculty a BESREDKA test can be carried out as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ml of antivenom is injected subcutaneously followed by 15 minutes watch then</li>
            <li>25 ml of antivenom is injected followed by another 15 minutes watch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If no reaction develops, the calculated dose of the antivenom should be given. In case of positive BESREDKA
            test or if the patient has a proven sensitivity to horse serum a GOAT antivenom may be given.</p>

        <div class="border-btm"></div>

        <p class="cpg-headers">Administration and Dosage </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>40 ml</strong> antivenom are diluted in approximately in <strong>5ml/kg</strong> Normal saline
            </li>
            <li>Infused intravenously slowly over a period of <strong>30-60 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Antivenom <strong>can be</strong> injected intravenously undiluted at a rate of 4 ml/ minute.</li>
            <li>No difference in the incidence or severity of antivenom reactions was observed in patients treated by
                either method. However, it is easier to control antivenom administration by the infusion method than by
                the intravenous "push technique".</li>
            <li>The antivenom dose can be <strong>repeated</strong> every <strong>4-6 hours</strong> until definite
                improvement takes place.</li>
            <li><strong>Children</strong> must be given the same dose of antivenom as adults.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="border-btm"></div>

        <p class="cpg-headers">Response to Antivenom</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Marked <strong>symptomatic improvement</strong> may be seen soon after antivenom administration.</li>
            <li>In shocked patients, the blood pressure may rise and consciousness return.</li>
            <li>Neurotoxic signs may improve within 30 minutes but generally take several hours.</li>
            <li>Spontaneous systemic bleeding usually stops within 15-30 minutes and blood coagulability is restored
                within 6 hours, provided that an adequate antivenom dose was given.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neurotoxic Envenoming</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bulbar and respiratory paralysis may lead to death from aspiration, airway obstruction or
                        respiratory" failure. Mechanical measures should be taken to maintain lung ventilation.
                        Anticholinesterases are potentially useful in these states.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fresh whole blood, fresh frozen plasma or a plasma expander can be used. Dopamine infusion can
                        be used in cases of</li>
                    <li>persistent or profound hypotension.</li>

                        undertaken</li>

        <p class="cpg-headers">Local infection at the site of the bite</p>
        <p><strong>Penicillin, erythromycin</strong> or a broad-spectrum antibiotic together with a booster dose of
            tetanus toxoid should be given in cases of wound infection.</p>
        <p>An aminoglycoside antibiotic such as gentamicin and metronidazole should be added if there is evidence of
            local necrosis.</p>
